## Systemless Substratum (Legacy/Layers Mode)
 A Magisk module which allows installation of Substratum themes in legacy/root mode
systemlessly.

 The new Substratum OMS mode works systemlessly but requires support for it in the ROM.
For the rest, the Legacy mode, which requires root access, normally writes in the
system partition.
 This module aims to provide this functionality via Magisk in a systemless way.
 
## Important Notes
 This module will not make Substratum Legacy work on your rom if it does not already.
 
 In the uninstaller directory there is an uninstaller zip that can be flashed in recovery.
This will remove both the module and everything Substratum saves in /data when you apply
themes. DO NOT use the rescue zips Substratum saves in sdcard. Use this instead if something
goes wrong or you want to wipe ALL Substratum overlays.
You will have to reinstall the module afterwards.
